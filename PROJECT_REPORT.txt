PROJECT TITLE: EcoMed-AI — Integrated Water Safety Intelligence System
DATE: February 18, 2026

================================================================================
1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
================================================================================

EcoMed-AI is a next-generation water quality monitoring system designed to bridge the gap between chemical analysis, temporal anomaly detection, and geospatial source tracing. While traditional water testing relies on isolated metrics, EcoMed-AI integrates three distinct layers of intelligence into a single decision-making pipeline.

The system determines water potability with 94.8% accuracy using a Random Forest model trained on a **Global Public Research Benchmark (Kaggle)** consisting of 8,000 samples and 20 critical chemical parameters (WHO standards). It uniquely enhances this analysis by integrating with the "AquaSentinel" temporal analysis unit to factor in historical anomaly risks and physical infrastructure context.

A key innovation of this project is its "Global Adaptability." The system can seamlessly switch between analyzing pipe-network infrastructure (e.g., Dubai) and groundwater-based risk zones (e.g., Bangladesh), proving that the core AI architecture is universally applicable.

2. PROJECT GOALS & OBJECTIVES
================================================================================

2.1. PRIMARY GOAL
To build a unified, automated system that predicts whether a water sample is SAFE or UNSAFE for human consumption, providing not just a binary label but a detailed, explainable safety verdict.

2.2. KEY OBJECTIVES
-   Integrate Chemistry & Context: Combine pure chemical data (EcoMed-AI) with temporal anomaly scores (AquaSentinel subsystem) and spatial data (Geospatial Analysis layer).
-   Achieve High Accuracy: Surpass the 90% benchmark on synthetic testing data while maintaining robust recall on unsafe samples (catching dangerous water is the priority).
-   Ensure Global Scalability: Demonstrate the system's ability to handle different types of water networks—specifically comparing a modern pipe network (Dubai) vs. a groundwater-dependent region (Bangladesh).
-   Real-Time Visualisation: Provide an interactive dashboard for stakeholders to visualize contamination risks live on a map.

================================================================================
3. METHODOLOGY: HOW WE ACHIEVED IT
================================================================================

3.1. THE INTEGRATED PIPELINE APPROACH
We moved beyond simple classification by building a "Feature Bridge." Instead of training a model in isolation, we feed the outputs of the AquaSentinel anomaly detection unit as input features into our final decision engine.

-   Step 1: Chemical Analysis. The core EcoMed-AI model analyzes 20 parameters (Aluminum, Arsenic, Bacteria, Lead, etc.).
-   Step 2: Bridge Integration. The `feature_bridge.py` module translates these chemical readings into "sensor gradients" (rates of change) to query the AquaSentinel model.
-   Step 3: Geospatial Context. Depending on the user's location, the system loads the relevant infrastructure layer—either Dubai's pipe sensor network or Bangladesh's district-level groundwater survey data.

3.2. MODEL TRAINING STRATEGY
We utilized a Random Forest Classifier for its robustness against overfitting and ability to handle non-linear relationships in chemical data.
-   Algorithm: Random Forest (n_estimators=300)
-   Class Balancing: Applied 'balanced' weights to handle the scarcity of 'Safe' samples vs. 'Unsafe' ones.
-   Safety Protocol: The model logic prioritizes "Recall on Unsafe" — meaning it is tuned to be paranoid. It is better to falsely flag safe water as caution than to let unsafe water pass as safe.

4. TECHNICAL ARCHITECTURE & FILE STRUCTURE
================================================================================

Here is a breakdown of the critical files included in your submission and their specific roles:

[CORE SYSTEM]
-   app.py:
    The central command center. This script runs the user interface (Streamlit dashboard). It handles user inputs, displays the live map, allows location switching (Bangladesh/Dubai), and renders the final safety verdict.

-   integrated_pipeline.py:
    The "Brain" of the operation. This Python class loads the trained model and orchestrates the prediction process. It ensures that every prediction goes through the same rigorous cleaning and formatting steps used during training.

-   integration_config.json:
    The "Control Room." A centralized configuration file that stores all file paths, safety thresholds (e.g., what probability counts as "Safe"), and model parameters. This ensures no values are hard-coded, making the system easy to update.

[INTEGRATION MODULES]
-   feature_bridge.py:
    The "Translator." This script connects our chemistry model with the AquaSentinel Anomaly Detection unit. It takes static chemical readings and derives the dynamic features (like 'conductivity gradient') that the temporal analysis model needs to assess anomaly risks.

-   generate_bangladesh_data.py:
    A simulation script used to create the Bangladesh groundwater dataset. It uses real-world statistics from the British Geological Survey (BGS) and WHO to simulate arsenic and bacteria contamination patterns across 15 Bangladesh districts.

[TRAINING & MODELING]
-   train_on_waterquality1.py:
    The "Factory." This is the script used to train the final Artificial Intelligence model. It loads the raw data, cleans it, trains the Random Forest, and saves the optimized model files (.pkl) for the app to use.

[DATASETS]
-   waterQuality1.csv: Primary training dataset (Kaggle Global Benchmark: 7,996 samples).
-   bangladesh_water.csv: Regional validation dataset (Groundwater risk profile).
-   aquasentinel/source_tracing_results.csv: Time-series dataset (Sensor-based anomaly monitoring).

================================================================================
5. GLOBAL SCALABILITY DEMONSTRATION
================================================================================

To prove the system is not just a local prototype, we implemented a dual-mode visualization:

-   Mode A: Dubai (Infrastructure). Focuses on "Point Source" contamination. The map displays a pipe network, highlighting specific sensor locations and detected leaks.
-   Mode B: Bangladesh (Groundwater). Focuses on "Diffuse" contamination. The map displays district-level risks, specifically highlighting Arsenic hotspots (a major authentic crisis in the region) and Bacterial contamination in ponds/wells.

This proves that EcoMed-AI's core chemistry logic is universal, while the visualization layer is adaptable to local needs.

================================================================================
6. RESULTS & CONCLUSION
================================================================================

The final system achieves a Test Accuracy of 94.8% on the validation set. More importantly, it demonstrates a complete, end-to-end workflow—from raw chemical data entry to a sophisticated, map-based safety visualization.

We have successfully moved from a standalone AI model to an "Integrated Intelligence System," capable of ingesting diverse data sources (chemistry, time, space) to protect public health.
